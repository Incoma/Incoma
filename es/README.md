Incoma
======

Incoma is a free software debate platform whose aim is to facilitate conversations between thousands of people simultaneously, to allow the construction of a real global collective intelligence.

The default index.php version is the PHP/MySQL version of Incoma which uses the MySQL database to store the conversations. A local version without PHP/MySQL can be executed loading index-local.html without no installation.

Try Incoma in its main page: [incoma.org] [1]

You can find more information in the Incoma project blog: [blog.incoma.org] [2] If you have questions, suggestions, if you find a bug, want to share something nice with us, or anything else, please write us to the e-mail on top.
Remember that Incoma is FREE SOFTWARE (free as in Braveheart). So it is yours and of the rest of the humanity. Because everything is a remix. Because we love the 99%.

Enjoy!
